# EPEVER-Modbus
Python Script for loading data from EPEVER solar charge controllers

This was heavily inspired by multiple repository
Go read:

https://github.com/kasbert/epsolar-tracer
https://github.com/plopp/python-modbus-epever-xtra
and PDF files included in this repository.

I strongly recommend to you to watch a short video below how to make RS485 to USB cable for communication between your PC and your preference of solar charge controller from EPEVER.
